# Overview
For the FIRST Robotics competition, the team will use the programming language Java.
There are several rules we keep to try to keep our code clean and working.

## Key Project FIles
Robot.Java - main robot class run when robot boots up
OI.java - binds commands to controllers


## Programming Rules

1. Comment your code
Anything after **`//`** is ignored by the program.   
Use this to explain sections of code so other people can understand easily

2. Name objects appropriately in CamelCase
All objects should be named CamelCase,where the first letter of each word is capitalized (Example: Team5901
The exception to this rule is methods, which the first word is lowercase (Ex: raiseElevatorComand

3. No spaces in names. Java doesnt like spaces.

4. All statements must end with **`;`**

5. Blocks of code are contained within brackets **`{ }`**.
