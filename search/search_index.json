The goal is to provide students basic Java knowledge to survive build season. This is NOT a comprehensive guide on Java - refer to online guides for a more detailed guide, Commenting code COmments can be used to document code, but can also be used to ignore parts of code. Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). Multi-line comments start with / and ends with /. // This is a comment System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); Any text between / and / will be ignored by Java. Variables & Data Types In Java, variables store data values. Different data values are represented by different Data Types . Data types represent different kinds of variables. Some variables store numbers, other stores text, etc. To create a variable, the following syntax is used: <type> <variable name> = <value>; A few of the common ones we will use can be seen below: Data Type Description Example Declaration int stores integers int age = 5; double stores fractional numbers double cost = 3.5; boolean stores true or false boolean LightOn = true; String Stores text, surrounded by double quotes String Name = \"Cougar Pack\"; Math Functions Sometimes, our algorithm will require us to make calculations. Here are some common functionss we may use: Function Description Example Usage Math.max(x,y) returns the maximum of x and y Math.max(20,5) would be return as 20 Math.min(x,y) returns the minimum of x and y Math.min(20,5) would be return as 5 Math.sqrt(x) returns the square root of x Math.sqrrt(100) would be return as 10 Math.abs(x) reutnrs absolute value of x Math.abs(-100) would return 100 Operators Operators perform operations on variables and values. Here are some common operators we may use: Arithmetic Operators Operator Description Example Usage + addition 5+3 returns 8 - subtraction 5 - 3 returns 2 * multiplication 5* 3 returns 15 / division 5/3 returns 1.66 % modulous (remainder) 5%3 returns 2 Comparison Operators Comparison operators compare two values. The result is returned as a boolean (true or false) Operator Description Example Usage == Equal to 5 == 3 would return false != Not Equal 5 != 3 would return true > Greater than 5 > 3 would return true. 5 > 5 would return false. < Less than 5 < 3 would return false. 5 < 3 would return false. >= Greater than or equal to 5 >= 3 would return true. 5 >= 5 would return true. <= Less than or equal to 5 < 3 would return false. 5 <= 5 would return true. Comparison Operators Logical operators are used to determine logic between variables Operator Description Example Usage && AND - returns true if both statements are true (5 > 3) && (6 > 6) would return false & & ! NOT - returns true if false, return false if true !(5 > 3) would return false If-else If-elses are used for control logic if (condition1) { } else if (condition2) { } else { } Example: int grade = 75; if (grade > 90){ system.out.println(\"Grade is an A\"); } else if (grade > 80){ system.out.println(\"Grade is an B\"); } else if (grade > 70){ system.out.println(\"Grade is an C\"); } else if (grade > 60){ system.out.println(\"Grade is an D\"); } else { system.out.println(\"Grade is an F\"); } Methods A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

Creating a TalonSRX Object Place this in the class constructor under public class <Subsystem_name> extends SubsystemBase private final WPI_TalonSRX <motorcontrollername> = new WPI_TalonSRX(X); The number X corresponds to the CANId of the motor controller. Each motor controller has a unique CANId to make sure the correct one is called. Creating a VictorSP Object Place this under public class <Subsystem_name> extends SubsystemBase private final WPI_VictorSPX <motorcontrollername> = new WPI_VictorSPX(X); The number X corresponds to the CANId of the motor controller. Creating Motor Controller Methods A method is a function of the subsystem. Other parts of code can call the method, which will automatically run the block of code between the {}. This allows for code to be reused throughout the program. To create a method, place the following code before the final bracket. Be sure to name the method starting with a lowercase letter, then camelCase. public void <method_name>(){ } If you would like to pass a parameter into the method, use the following syntax. Multiple parameters can be passed if needed. public void <method_name>(<datatype> <parameter_name>){ } Methods should be placed at the bottom of the subsystem, but still contained within the class like so: Motor Controller Functions Each motor controler comes with a pre-built library of common functions. The most common are below: Methods Description Example set if control mode = PercentOutpuit, value of [-1,1] LeftElevatorMotor(1.0); setInverted switches rotation of motor (by default, positive values are counterclockwise, negative values are clockwise) LeftElevatorMotor.setInverted(true) Cell stopMotor stops motor LeftElevatorMotor.stopmotor(); For a full description, see the following links TalonSRX API VictorSP API Example A function of an elevator may be to lift to a certain height, lower, or to stop. The motors controlling the elevator will push the elevator in a certain direction. To do the above, the following functions were created: This sets the elevator motor that we created earlier at a certain value.
